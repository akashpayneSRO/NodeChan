This document describes the formatting of data packets sent over UDP on the NodeChan network.



Header bytes:

BYTE 0 - 'N'
BYTE 1 - 'C'

BYTE 2 - type
 -'P' --> post

BYTE 3 - flags

BYTES 4-7 - sender IP



Layout of a post ('P') packet:
BYTE 8-15 - thread ID

BYTE 16-23 - post ID

BYTE 24-73 - title of the thread the post belongs to

BYTE 74-329 - post text



Layout of a hello-packet ('H'):
Hello-packets contain no data beyond the header bytes. These packets are only
used for a client to add itself to one of its peers' peer list, or for the
client to keep itself alive in its peers' peer list.
